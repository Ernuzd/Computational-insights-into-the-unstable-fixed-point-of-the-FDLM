The purpose of this repository is to provide source code of the relevant tables and graphs to verify the computational experiments conducted in the article here in the order they are arranged in the manuscript.

A brief description of each file:

Figure1.m - The bifurcation diagram of the classical logistic map with unstable period-1 and unstable period-2 trajectories plotted on top with blue and red points respectively.

Table3.m - The classification of the parameter values of a at N = 2.

Table4.m - The relation between N and \rho(N).

Table5.m - The relationship between \rho_U(N), \rho_L(N), and N.

Figure2.m - A Monte-Carlo approach to finding the ratio between type-1 and type-2 values of a between (3, 4] (unstable period-1 orbit).

Figure3.m - A Monte-Carlo approach to finding the ratio between type-1 and type-2 values of a between (1 + sqrt(6), 4] ((unstable period-2 orbit)).

Figure4_and_5.m - 

  Figure 4 : The bifurcation diagram of the fractional difference logistic map. The red dots denote such values of a in the interval
2.7 < a ≤ 3.7 where the trajectory remains at the fixed point (Type-2 values of a) at N = 15 and μ = 0.8. Note that the
a-axis is shown in the logarithmic scale.

  Figure 5:  Showcases 2 initial conditions from which the first one stays in the fixed point while the second initial condition does not. All computations are performed at N = 15 and μ = 0.8.
